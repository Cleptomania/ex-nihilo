# Ex-Nihilo 1.7.10
Fork of Ex-Nihilo from [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/RedRockFowl/ex-nihilo/src/master/) and [decompiled 1.38-53](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ex-nihilo)


New Features:
* Completely Re-worked Sieve, inspired by the 1.12 version Ex-Nihilo Creatio.
    * Support for operating multiple sieves at once, with a configurable radius
    * Support for multiple mesh types, meaning you can remove meshes and put different types in, and have different rewards for different mesh types, this also has a re-worked NEI integration to support it.
    * Substantially improved behavior of the sieve, no longer ticks and works on time intervals, it is event driven and has substantially improved netcode.
* New Crook Types
    * Added Stone, Iron, Gold, and Diamond crooks. Inspired by the 1.12 version of Ex Nihilo.
    * Previously only had wood and bone crooks
* Re-worked config to be more modular and expandable for future features
* Lots of general refactors for future development
